<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm now a year 3 Ph.D student at [ARISE Lab](http://ariselab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) in The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof.Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/home). 

My research interests are mainly in quality assurance in software maintainance. Specifically, it's quality assurance for logging statements and code comments.
